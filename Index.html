    <!--What is Html?-->
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML <b>(Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is a markup language used to create and structure web pages. It is the standard language used to create documents that can be displayed on the World Wide Web (WWW) and is the foundation of all websites. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page using tags.</p>

    <p> HTML is a language that is easy to learn and understand, making it accessible to people with little or no technical background. It uses a set of tags that describe the structure of a document and its content. These tags define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms, among others. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most tags have an opening and closing tag.</p>
        
    <p> HTML is an essential tool for web developers and designers, as it allows them to create websites that are accessible to users across different devices and platforms. HTML works in tandem with other languages like CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web pages.</p>
        
    <p> In summary, HTML is the backbone of the web, and without it, we would not have the web as we know it today. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding HTML is crucial to building and maintaining a successful website.</p>

    <!--What are the uses of HTML?-->
    <h2>What are the uses of HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It is a fundamental technology that allows for the structure and presentation of content on the web. Here are some of the main uses of HTML:</p>

       <p> 1. Creating web pages: HTML is the foundation of all web pages, and it provides the structure and content for websites. HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.</p>
        
       <p> 2. Formatting text and images: HTML can be used to format text and images on a web page, such as setting font size, color, and style. Images can also be inserted into web pages using HTML.</p>
        
       <p>3. Creating links: HTML can be used to create links between web pages and other online resources. Links are created using the anchor tag and allow users to navigate between different pages on a website or to other websites.</p>
        
       <p>4. Inputting forms: HTML provides a way for users to input data into web pages through forms. Forms are created using HTML tags and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as registering for an account or submitting a contact form.</p>
        
       <p>5. Building web applications: HTML is used in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to build interactive web applications. HTML provides the structure for web pages, while CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used for interactivity and functionality.</p>
        
       <p>Overall, HTML is an essential technology for creating web pages and web applications, and its versatility and ease of use have made it the standard markup language of the web.</p>
    
    <!--Differentiate between an Ordered list and an Unordered list?-->
    <h2>Differentiate between an Ordered list and an Unordered list?</h2>
    <p>In HTML, lists are an essential way of organizing information in a structured format. There are two types of lists: Ordered and Unordered. The fundamental difference between them is the way in which they present the content.</p>
    <p>An ordered list, also known as a numbered list, is used to list a set of items in a particular sequence or order. The items in an ordered list are preceded by numbers, letters, or roman numerals, depending on the chosen list style. Ordered lists are used when the order of the items is significant or when the items need to be referenced later. For example, a recipe that lists ingredients in the order they should be added to a dish is an excellent use case for an ordered list.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, an unordered list, also known as a bullet point list, is used to present items in no particular order. The items in an unordered list are preceded by a bullet point, a dash, or other special characters, depending on the chosen list style. Unordered lists are commonly used to present a series of related items, such as a grocery list or a list of to-do items.</p>
    <p>Another key difference between the two types of lists is their appearance. Ordered lists are typically more structured and formal, while unordered lists are more casual and relaxed. Ordered lists use a sequential numbering system to organize content, while unordered lists use visual markers, such as bullets or icons, to separate items.</p>
    <p>In summary, while both ordered and unordered lists are useful for organizing information, they have different purposes and presentations. Ordered lists are used when the sequence or order of items is important, while unordered lists are used to present a series of related items in no particular order.</p>
